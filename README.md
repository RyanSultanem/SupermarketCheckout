# Context 

A supermarket would like to have a checkout system that generates a Receipt given a list of product items chosen from a customer.

The supermarket would be filled with multiple types of products the customer can choose from. The supermarket also offers some discounting rules that allow the customer to benefit from free items when bought with certain conditions. Some of the products are eligible for the discounting deals.  

The produced receipt should properly show the initial chosen items, the discounted items, and the total amount to be paid by the customer.
